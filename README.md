# hello-world
Just trying to learn stuff

My name is Lucas Forcato, known by my friends on the internet by Fork. 
I'm 23 years old, started to coding 3 (or 4) months ago. 
My goal is to be a mobile developer, focusing on Swift/iOS. 

I'm learning how to deal with version control and github repositories, this is kinda simple and fun.
I rly hope that I'll get into it. 

Good luck, future me.
